Implemented an ordered map and unordered map from scratch to store ingredients from USDA National Nutrient Database. With these incredients, various meal plans were created based on user-inputed data about their health and activity level. Serves to be a easy way for users to get a personally curated meal plan that will help them achieve their fitness goals.
